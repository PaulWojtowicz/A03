Glossary:
* **Branch** -  Represents an independent line of development for the user. It is a way to request a brand new working directory. New **commits** are recorded in the history of the current **branch**, which results in a fork in the project’s history.
* **Clone** - Creating a **repository** containing the revisions from another **repository**.
* **Commit** - Operation that sends the latest changes to the source code to the **repository**, making these changes part of the head revision of the **repository**.
* **Fetch** - Only downloads new data from a **remote repository**, but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into the files you are working on.
* **GIT** - Software that is used for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during the course of software development.
* **GitHub** - Web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers to use. It makes coding easier by providing a web interface to **Git** and provides management tools for collaboration.
* **Merge** - Operation that combines multiple changes made to a version-controlled collection of files. It is necessary when a file is modified on two independent **branches** and merged afterward.
* **Merge Conflict** - Event that occurs when **Git** is not able to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits, potentially from two developers. **Git** does not know which code to keep and which to discard.
* **Push** - Will upload local **repository** files to a **remote repository**. Pushing files has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing.
* **Pull** - Not only downloads new data but also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.
* **Remote** - Refers to the technology used to give users access to networks and systems from off-site or not on the local machine.
* **Repository** - A data structure that stores data for a set of files and a historical record of changes since its creation.
