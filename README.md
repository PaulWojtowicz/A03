Glossary:

Branch - A branch represents an independent line of development for the user. It is a way to request a brand new working directory. New commits are recorded in the history of the current branch, which results in a fork in the project’s history.
Clone - Creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository.
Commit - An operation that sends the latest changes to the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository.
Fetch - This only downloads new data from a remote repository, but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into the files you are working on.
GIT - Software that is used for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during the course of software development.
GitHub - A web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers to use. It makes coding easier by providing a web interface to Git and provides management tools for collaboration.
Merge - This is an operation that combines multiple changes made to a version-controlled collection of files. It is necessary when a file is modified on two independent branches and merged afterward.
Merge Conflict - An event that occurs when Git is not able to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits, potentially from two developers. Git does not know which code to keep and which to discard.
Push - This will upload local repository files to a remote repository. Pushing files has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing.
Pull - This not only downloads new data but also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.
Remote - This refers to the technology used to give users access to networks and systems from off-site or not on the local machine.
Repository - This is a data structure that stores data for a set of files and a historical record of changes since its creation.
